TODO:
* refactor jump into the sprite setting a bool for intention to jump and the world then calculating the jump based on surroundings.


* implement stopping when running into side of something
* implement stopping when hitting the bottom of something
* implment faster falling gravity than 1. <<-- requires looking for future collisions

Last left off at:
Adding a test for detecting possible collisions. There are failures due to setup -- "hitsTop" is always firing true when not testing for it
Refactoring terrain collisions into a surroundings object.
Need to add something like "stopRight" / "stopLeft" for the controllable sprite to stop it's movements.
